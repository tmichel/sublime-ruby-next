Ruby:
====

* Heredoc does not recognize methods in heredoc definition
  
  Example
  
  <<EOL.squish unless foo
  This is the body of the heredoc
  EOF
  
  Everything after the . should be recognized as simple ruby

* Some of special methods should be de-emphasized when used as an actual method. e.g. "world".prepend("hello")
